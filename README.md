# Jquery-Practical-Examples
**That's my first time creating a repository in Github, and it's a practice of The [Jquery practical Examples course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66QpkBLJ4_k&list=PLDoPjvoNmBAz0_Ujf9ZB9KceUzzSVYDci)**, from **[Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSNkfKl4cU-55Nm-ovsvOHQ) channel** in Youtube.
### Description:
There is 19 segments, each segment contains a practical example, but for the last ones I didn't do just a practice I made new Ideas based on the videos.
> **I've used Semantic UI framework just for styling, so I didn't attach the semantic.js file to my project.**
> **I've also used the [colorjoe js library](https://bebraw.github.io/colorjoe) for the eleventh example.**
